Since we will have scATACseq, we will use Signac from Seurat 

Just a reminder, we have scATACseq and snRNAseq from 2 conditions old and young. So I will analyze each of them separately then integrate them, first between the same modality (old/young) then between 2 modalities (ATAC/RNA) 

1. Loading data
2. scATACseq
   - 2.1 old
   - 2.2 young
   - 2.3 integrate
3. snRNAseq
    - 3.1 old
    - 3.2 young
    - integrate
